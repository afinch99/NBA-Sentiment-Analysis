### Content Analysis Paper exploring the difference in emotional reactions to a trade between the New York Knicks and Toronto Raptors.

Trades between two sports teams, by nature of both teams agreeing to the transaction, are meant to be mutually beneficial. In theory, both teams are attempting to maximize value and achieve their franchise goals. In practice, however, it is often the case that reactions to a trade are very different between fanbases. To understand why this might be, it is important to examine the themes that emerge among fanbases following a major trade. On December 30, 2023, the New York Knicks and Toronto Raptors of the National Basketball Association (NBA) finalized a trade with each other. In this deal, the Knicks sent RJ Barrett, Immanuel Quickley, and a second-round draft pick to the Raptors, receiving OG Anunoby and Precious Achiuwa in return. The varying emotional reactions from both fanbases make this trade an interesting focus of analysis.
